        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Hawaiian pizza has a nice crunchy crust with flavorful toppings, including pineapple that has a slight smoky flavor.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan</li>
            <li>2 slices applewood-smoked bacon</li>
            <li>4 canned pineapple rings</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh pizza dough, at room temperature</li>
            <li>½ cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup thinly sliced red onion</li>
            <li>4 slices Canadian bacon, cut into 1-inch triangles</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) with a rack in the lower<br>
                position. Oil a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. </p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and cook, flipping<br>
                occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper<br>
                towel-lined plate. </p></li>
            <li><p>Pour out pan drippings without wiping pan clean, and return skillet to heat.<br> 
                Add pineapple, cook until lightly browned and caramelized, 3 minutes per side.<br>
                Remove from pan. Chop bacon and cut pineapple rings into 3/4-inch pieces. </p></li>
            <li><p>On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12-inch circle and place on the oiled<br>
                baking sheet. Prick dough with a fork several times to reduce air bubbles.<br>
                Spread pizza sauce evenly over dough, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border around<br>
                edges. Sprinkle with cheese, red onion, Canadian bacon, chopped pineapple,<br>
                and chopped bacon. </p></li>
            <li><p>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, toppings are lightly<br>
                charred, and crust is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before<br> 
                serving.</p></li>
        </ol>
